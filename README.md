# Data-extraction-and-manipulation
This project aims to visualize state-wise data percentages using Python and pandas.
The project involves extracting data from text files, converting it into a pandas DataFrame, and then calculating the percentages of data for each state.
The visualization is done using matplotlib, a popular plotting library in Python.
